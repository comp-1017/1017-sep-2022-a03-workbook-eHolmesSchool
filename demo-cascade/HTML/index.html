    <!--<a>this is an anchor tag, incorrectly called a "Link Tag". One should not use the phrase "Link Tag" because there is an actual Link tag used in the head area.
    the AAnchor tag can take you to a different website or A different location on the same website

    Paramaters: the HRef points to the desired location
    Target: OPTIONAL. Default is saying "Browser Display Page" (i dont understand what this means but the teacher wronte it sooooooooo)
    _blank:  will open the destination in a new browser tab

        <!-- img tag! Lets gooooooo
        the Image tag does not have a closing tag because tere is no "content" to display
        Parameters: src: site location
        alt: Printable Text if image is not found on file
        [title: tooltip text for the image (when you hold cursor over image)] [Square brackets means optional]
        the relative path is from the top of the website down/up to the desired image you want to reference.
        
        If you are going Down, you need to include all sub-folders names and the final file name. ex.if starting at top of Framework i would go folder1/folder2/.../file
        Going Up, use the string.doc to go up a level (that is, to go up a sub-folder) ..../.../folder1/file
