if you have the same rules for multiple element selectors you may group them as a comma separated list
The group may be coded on one physical line or over multiple lines

If you repeat the element selector in your css file, any additional rules sre combined with previously specified rules. If you re-code a previously specified rule then the new rule overrides the previous rule. Last Rule Wins

/*********
Descendant selectors

A descendant selector is a set  of element selectors when used in your html, follow immediately one after another..
This can be used to isolate a particular selector from other occurances of the same selector on the page

The descendant has two OR MORE element selectors


this would color ALL unordered lists
ul{
    background-color: lightblue;
}

this ONLY gets ULs in the footer area   THERE IS NO COMMA OR ANYTHING
ul{
    background-color: lightblue;
}

this technique will over ride generic styles

footer ul{
    background-color: lightblue;
